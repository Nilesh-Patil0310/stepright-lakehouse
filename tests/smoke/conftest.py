Fixtures for the prod smoke test — deliberately separate from
tests/integration/conftest.py, not a shared/parameterized version of it.
This suite must never touch landing, never trigger full_refresh, and never
assert against fixed-seed-specific values — reusing integration's fixtures
risked inheriting assumptions (reset_uat's landing-clearing, for instance)
that would be actively dangerous pointed at real production data.
